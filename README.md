## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  - Vehicle_length
  - Ground_clearance
 
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
  - The slope is not considered to be zero. This is because the p-values for the above mentioned variables are have a p-value of less than 0.05, therefore wer can be confident that a change in those variables will be associated with a change in mpg.


- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
  - The linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because it has an r-squared value of 0.7149.
